        <h2 class="text">Plains</h2>
        <p>
          Plains are a common biome, usually treeless. They spawn many passive
          mobs such as pigs, cows, sheep, and horses. They usually border
          forests. Sunflower plains are the only biome where you can find
          sunflowers.

        <h2 class="text">Forests</h2>
        <p>
          Forests are great places to start because some of them have lots of
          trees for harvesting wood. Other variations of forest include the
          flower forest that grows nearly every kind of flower in Minecraft.

        <h2 class="text">Jungles</h2>
        <p>
          Three types of jungle biomes occur in Minecraft. The first is a normal
          jungle biome and the second is a jungle edge biome. Jungle edge biomes
          are essentially mixed biomes to transition from jungle biomes into
          others. The third variation is a bamboo jungle, which you can often
          find inside larger jungle biomes.

        <h2 class="text">Mountains</h2>
        <p>
          You know you're in a mountain biome when you see a lot of stone,
          floating islands, alcoves, and spires. Mountain biomes are also the
          only places where you can find emeralds, which are great for trading
          with villagers.

        <h2 class="text">Deserts</h2>
        <p>
          Desert biomes are very bare. They contain sand, sandstone, dead
          bushes, brown rabbits, and cacti. In these biomes you can sometimes
          find desert villages, pillager outposts, temples, and wells with
          lakes. A desert lake biome is an oasis amid a vast desert.

        <h2 class="text">Taiga</h2>
        <p>
          Taiga biomes combine jungle and forest biomes. They typically have
          spruce trees and ferns. Taigas can contain wolves, foxes, sweet berry
          bushes, villages, pillager outposts, and more. The giant tree taiga
          variation of the taiga biome contains much larger spruce trees and
          podzol on the ground.

        <h2 class="text">Snowy Tundra</h2>
        <p>
          Snowy tundra biomes feature vast amounts of land covered in snow.
          Wildlife is scarce but they do have polar bears and rabbits.

        <h2 class="text">Ice Spikes</h2>
        <p>
          The rare ice spikes biome presents large structures and clumps of ice
          scattered around almost like trees. Resources here are even more
          difficult to find than in the snow tundra biome, but this biome does
          have large amounts of ice.

        <h2 class="text">Swamps</h2>
        <p>
          Swamp biomes are usually one of the most dangerous biomes to survive
          in. Witch huts generate in these biomes and slime spawns occur
          naturally at night.
